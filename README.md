Welcome to Thingy, a simple and intuitive Todo List web app that helps you organize and manage your tasks efficiently. You can create tasks, manage projects and set priorities.
Features
Add Tasks: Create tasks with a title, description, priority, and due date. Projects: Manage different projects and assign tasks to them. Task Counter: Shows the number of tasks in each project. Task Status: Mark tasks as completed or pending. Local Storage: Your projects and tasks are saved locally in your browserâ€™s storage, so your data persists even after you refresh the page or close the browser. Bugs and Known Issues
While the app is functional, there are a few bugs that I will be addressing in the future:
Task Counter Malfunction: The task counter, which keeps track of how many tasks are added to each project, is not working as expected. It might not update or display the correct number of tasks for a particular project. Cannot Add Tasks to the Last Project: For some reason, when there is only one project left, I am unable to add new tasks to that project. This is an issue I will be investigating and fixing. Cannot Delete the Last Project: Deleting the last remaining project is not working properly. The app prevents you from deleting the final project, which I will work on resolving. Future Plans
Fix the task counter to ensure it correctly reflects the number of tasks in each project. Investigate the issue with adding tasks to the last project and ensure it works as intended. Resolve the problem with deleting the last project. Feel free to contribute or open an issue if you encounter any other problems or have suggestions for improvements!
